       <h3>Iaraš was born as the great-granddaughter of a relatively limited conlang passion project made earlier, but it strove to have proper grammar and more natural features of a language to imitate a natlang, unlike its ancestors. As many conlangs are, this project is constantly being worked on, edited and improved, so there is no definitive  or official version. Thank your for coming!/Yål ardnte ånešva!</h3>
